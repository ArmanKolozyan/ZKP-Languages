# Empirical Study of Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Languages
This repository presents an empirical study of Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) languages (including zkVMs), offering an overview of the most prominent ones. The study leverages the GitHub API to gather and analyse key metrics about repositories related to each language (e.g., number of stars, date of last update, etc.).

## Overview

This repository includes:

- A quantitative analysis of repositories for many ZKP languages using metrics such as:
    - Number of stars
    - Number of open issues
    - Date of last update
    - Number of contributors
- Visualizations to highlight interesting trends.
- All code used for data collection and visualization.

## Studied ZKP Languages

This study covers the following ZKP languages:

| Name          | Type       |
|---------------|------------|
| **Circom**    | HDL        |
| **ZoKrates**  | DSL        |
| **Cairo**     | DSL        |
| **Nexus VM**  | zkVM       |
| **RISC Zero** | zkVM       |
| **snarkVM**   | zkVM       |
| **SP1**       | zkVM       |

- **HDL**: Hardware Description Language, used for circuit descriptions.
- **DSL**: Domain-Specific Language, designed specifically for writing ZKP programs.
- **zkVM**: Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machine, a virtual machine designed to execute programs written in standard programming languages while generating zero-knowledge proofs of their correctness.
